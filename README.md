# School-English-Project
Recently I had a english school project that I had to do. It had to do with countries and facts. Basically, for 10 countries, for each one I would write a (weird) fact about it

# Why is this even a webiste lol?
Good question. The problem is that as of now I have a 2006 something printer. Of course it is the HP DeskJet F380 All-In-One. Nowdays, I have trouble doing pritining on it. So I asked if I can do it in another way like Kahoot!, PowerPoint and etc. The teacher agreed so I made the website. 

# Is this some AI slop* again?
* The HTML was written all by me,

* The CSS was written by Google-Antigravity (The UI was decribed by me) (I mean it was 12:00am when I made this...so I kinda needed help)

*The Javascript logic was written 50-50. Basically, 50% by me (from python experience) and 50% by the AI (mostly for help)

As of now, I do not know much of web development, I only know a bit. However, I am learning and focusing on it so I can learn how to build apps for mobile/desktop and websites. This is just the beggining, In the future, I will be more serious and I will probably not even use AI at all (or a little but I will always let you know if I have used AI). If you would like to check my promnts, I have written a file for that in the repostiory.

Side note: Don't let the emojis fool you, I added them for ashetics. Also, I DO NOT SUPPORT vibe coding by just blidnly copy pasting but rather understanding how the code the LLM gives you works. I am actually learning web development right now 

* AI slop: Means that something was made with AI fully without a human putting any effort to making it. For instance, an image instead of being taken via a camera, it was made fully with AI. Luckily this project does not follow this and it seriously hates it 

# How it works?
Simple, answer the questions and check results

# How to run it?
* Download the zip or clone it using git
* Open the HTML file
* Enjoy

# Contributing
Well unless the code has an issue or want to add yourself a fact on countries like how I have done (You will provide the Fact and the Reason), it is pointless. Like I said I posted it here because I want to share it and because how I am going to run it on the class laptop (Why I didn't thought of a USB stick, whatever)

# License: 
Why would you need a license for this? Take the code and heck even claim it's yours I do not care (Just for this project though, not in future ones which will have a license and will be actually good ones)

# Browser emoji issue note
If you open the HTML in a browser and do not see the country flags as emojis but rather you see country codes (liek FR, GR, JP, UK, etc). This is probably an issue with your operating system not having the emojis. On firefox you will not have a problem as it use the Twemoji Mozilla fonts baked into the browser. On the other hand, chromium uses the ones from the OS. If you don't see the emojis like I said, it may be an OS thing. Try doing research on a solution
