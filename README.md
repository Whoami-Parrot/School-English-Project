# School-English-Project
Recently I had a english school project that I had to do. It had to do with countries and facts. Basically, for 10 countries, for each one I would write a (weird) fact about it

# Why is this even a webiste lol?
Good question. The problem is that as of now I have a 2006 something printer. Of course it is the HP DeskJet F380 All-In-One. Nowdays, I have trouble doing pritining on it. So I asked if I can do it in another way like Kahoot!, PowerPoint and etc. The teacher agreed so I made the website. 

# Is this some AI slop again?
* The HTML was written all by me,

* The CSS was written by Google-Antigravity (The UI was decribed by me) (I mean it was 12:00am when I made this...so I kinda needed help)

*The Javascript logic was written 50-50. Basically, 50% by me (from python experience) and 50% by the AI (mostly for help)

As of now, I do not know much of web development, I only know a bit. However, I am learning and focusing on it so I can learn how to build apps for mobile/desktop and websites. This is just the beggining, In the future, I will be more serious and I will probably not even use AI at all (or a little but I will always let you know if I have used AI). If you would like to check my promnts, I have written a file for that in the repostiory.

Side note: Don't let the emojis fool you, I added them for ashetics. Also, I DO NOT SUPPORT vibe coding by just blidnly copy pasting but rather understanding how the code the LLM gives you works. I am actually learning web development right now 

# How it works?
Simple, answer the questions and check results

# How to run it?
* Download the zip or clone it using git
* Open the HTML file
* Enjoy

# Contributing
Well unless the code has an issue or want to add yourself a fact on countries like how I have done (You will provide the Fact and the Reason), it is pointless. Like I said I posted it here because I want to share it and because how I am going to run it on the class laptop (Why I didn't thought of a USB stick, whatever)

# License: 
Why would you need a license for this? Take the code and heck even claim it's yours I do not care (Just for this project though, not in future ones which will have a license and will be actually good ones)
