# School-English-Project
Recently I had a english school project that I had to Do. It had to do with countries and facts. Basically, for 10 countries, I would for each one a weird fact about it

# Why is this even a webiste lol?
Good question. The problem is that as of now I have a 2006 something printer. Of course it is the HP DeskJet F380 All-In-One. Nowdays, I have trouble priting it. So I asked if I can do it in another way like Kahoot!, PowerPoint and etc. The teacher agreed so I made the website. 

# Is this some AI slop again?
Well not really (not 100% by any means), I did use Google Anti-Gravity. As of publishing this, I do not know a lot of web development. Like only a small portion of HTML/CSS/JS -- from a python view because I do know python and some of every language. Fortunately, I find those 3 (HTML/CSS/JS) quite easy --. However, since I do know some HTML, CSS and some JavaScript, I coded the HTML all by myself, some of the CSS (most of it handled by the Agent) and some of the JavaScript logic (yes I did have some agent help there too). Moreover, that is just the beginning of my dev journey. Once I learn what i need, I will not use AI a lot or maybe NOT at all. In addition, I did not just blindly copy-paste code. I did check the code to make sure it is *functionable* as how it should be and I actually learned some stuff by just reading the code. Lastly, it's a very simple school project that I just wanted to share, some AI is not bad in this case :)

Side note: Don't let the emojis fool you, I added them for ashetics. Also, I DO NOT CODONE vibe coding by just blidnly copy pasting but rather understanding how the code the LLM gives you works. I am actually learning web development too

# How it works?
Simple, answer the questions and check results

# How to run it?
* Download the zip or clone it using git
* Open the HTML file
* Enjoy

# Contributing
Well unless the code has an issue or want to add yourself a fact on countries like how I have done (You will provide the Fact and the Reason), it is pointless. Like I said I posted it here because I want to share it and because how I am going to run it on the class laptop (Why I didn't thought of a USB stick, whatever)

# License: 
Why would you need a license for this? Take the code and heck even claim it's yours I do not care (Just for this project though, not in future ones which will have a license and will be actually good ones)
